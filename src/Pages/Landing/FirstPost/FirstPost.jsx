                In 2009, I was finishing up my 5th year as a Computer Science student. Grades didn’t matter as much to me, and the projects I was required to do in school were uninteresting and overdone. I was more entranced with creating mobile games and websites for the clients I’ve been working for the past few years. Whenever I was introduced to a new client, they’d ask me inevitably works I’ve done in the past. My usual response was to compile a list of websites and screenshots, and email them my repertoire. It worked for a while, but I was beginning to see how unscalable my approach was. I needed  

They say it’s quite rare to purchase your first name as a domain name. Luckily for me, my parents gave me a name that was unclaimed in the Internet world. When I saw joonsub.com was available, I told my mother that I needed to borrow her credit card and made the purchase. After a few hours of googling how to connect a domain name to a server, I was the proud owner of joonsub.com.

There was just one problem: I never had any inspiration to make a portfolio site. If I did it’d end up being scrapped. The perfectionist in me.

For 9 years, Joonsub.com was never updated.

That changes, today.

So what’s actually involved in making a website? For me the most difficult part was content, but a close second was design.

Putting it all together.
For the most part, I really liked how everything turned out. The header and about me section really speak to me in terms of my design language. The desktop view for the “Works” section feels a little out of place for me, but I hope to iterate on it soon. For mobile, the “Works” section is actually my favorite and the “About” section falls short.

This site has been a fun project for me and I’ve learned so much through it. It’s taught me.

I’d like to thank a few people who helped me along the process:
1. Yu and Ben for design critiques
2. Hannah for editing
3. Michael for general hating on the page. 

Hopefully the site won’t require a full redesign for another 5 years, but I’m quite happy how it turned out.
